Notes: 

- May want to split up InputExcelFile.R into two files, one for table methods, one for input file and datapath methods (limit clutter)

- May also want to limit comments since they clutter and break up code to the point where it is difficult to follow fluently

- In the learning process I feel comments are good but once I get the hang of it, I should limit them to only the most important parts
