# Finance Tracker/Budget App

This project is intended to be a financial tracker/budget dashboard. I aim for the user to be able to input a financial tracking sheet, which can be obtained by downloading the "Financial Sheet - Template.xlsx" file, and then be presented with visualizations, graphs, tables, and other methods of information distribution regarding their financial data.

I am still in the early learning phase of this project, mainly setting everything up and testing the various features I intend to implement to gain a better understanding of potential limitations I may need to overcome.
