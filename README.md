# Finance Tracker/Budget App

This project is intended to be a financial tracker/budget dashboard. I aim for the user to be able to input a financial tracking sheet, which can be obtained by downloading the "Financial Sheet - Template.xlsx" file, and then the app will present the user with informational visualizations, graphs, tables, and other methods of information distribution regarding their financial data.

I am still in the early learning phase of this project, mainly setting everything up and testing the various features I intend to implement to gain a better understanding of potential limitations I may need to overcome.

Currently, the app can take in the Financial Sheet.xlsx file and generate visuals which display the users current balance, total income to date, and total debits to date. The app also has a tab housing a table of the inputted financial data.

Things I'm working on now:

- Troubleshooting methods of getting the template file to the user.
- Generating and displaying the data visually via graphs and charts.
- *Later down the line* Allowing the user to distinguish between which month, months, or years the user wants the dashboard visuals to showcase.
